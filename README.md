# FaceDector
This program uses the computer's webcam and detects if any faces are present in its field of view. It uses OpenCV and dlib's facial landmarks recongnition database. This is far from a revolutionary application of this tool, rather just a way for me to get practice implementing facial detection. 

To run this, you will need to download the facial landmarks recongnition dat file, which can be attained from the following link. Simply put this file in the same folder as the python script and it should work.
